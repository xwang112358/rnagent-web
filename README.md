For the presentation and report, be sure to:
- Describe the dataset and why it is interesting.
- Explain how you acquired it (e.g. via an API, file download, etc).
    - Discuss the FAIRness of the data provider.
        - FAIR is a journey not a destination, so when considering each aspect find something that it does well and something that could be done better
        - Include: Was the data well-annotated with metadata? Was the license clear?
- Describe any data cleaning or other preprocessing.
    - e.g. If some data was missing, how did you handle it?
- Discuss summary statistics and how they do or do not reflect the characteristics of the data. (e.g. are they skewed by outliers, is missing data a problem? are they misleading because of non-continuous variables? etc?)
    - There are datasets where summary statistics are inappropriate (e.g., sound recordings, images, text)... if you think this applies to your data, consult with the professor on what to do instead
- Discuss the analyses you chose to run.
    - Why these questions?
    - What were the results?
    - Any surprises?
    - How did you validate your analyses?
- Describe your server API and the web front-end.
- Mention any surprising results or unexpected difficulties.
